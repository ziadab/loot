#What is loot?

  A python script to automate gathering passwords and 
  information from the current user and operating system.

##Configuration

  In order to use loot on a Windows system, you will need
  the executables provided by NirSoft (password tools).

  NirSoft's Password Recovery Tools:
    http://nirsoft.net/password_recovery_tools.html
	http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/wireless_key.html

  * Make sure to download tools with command-line options.
	
  Extract these to a folder named windows in the same
  directory where you currently have this script.

##Execution

  Compile for desired operating system (Linux, OSX, Win).
  You can use either PyInstaller or Py2Exe for that!
  Then simply transfer file to system and execute it.
  
  - For use in computer systems where you are authorized! ;)
