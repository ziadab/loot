1) What is loot?

  A python script to automate gathering passwords and 
  information from the current user and operating system.

2) Configuration

  In order to use loot on a Windows system, you will need
  the executables provided by NirSoft (password tools).

  NirSoft's Password Recovery Tools:
    http://nirsoft.net/password_recovery_tools.html
	http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/wireless_key.html

  * Make sure to download tools with command-line options.
	
  Extract these to a folder named windows in the same
  directory where you currently have this script.

3) Execution

  Compile for desired operating system (Linux, OSX, Win).
  You can use either PyInstaller or Py2Exe for that!
  Then simply transfer file to system and execute it.
  
  - For use in computer systems where you are authorized! ;)
